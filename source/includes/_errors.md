# Errors

<aside class="notice">This error section is stored in a separate file in <code>includes/_errors.md</code> Slate allows you to optionally separate out your docs into many files...just save them to the `includes` folder and add them to the top of your `index.md`'s frontmatter. Files are included in the order listed.</aside>
